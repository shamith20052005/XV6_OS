<h1 align="center">Process Management and Scheduling</h1>

##  :beginner: Overview
* This section is an attempt to understanding **Process Management** and **Scheduling** in **Xv6**.
* Current scheduler in Xv6 is an **unweighted round robin scheduler.**  
* In this section, I modified the scheduler to take into account user-defined process burst time and implemented:
    * **Shortest job first Scheduler**
    * **Hybrid Scheduler**
##  :round_pushpin: Some Prequisites
1) ### getNumProc function
* A system call that returns the total number of **active** processes in the system. This includes process in state :
     * **EMBRYO** (New process is being created)
     * **RUNNABLE** (Process is ready to run)
     * **RUNNING** (Process is executing)
     * **SLEEPING** (Blocked for an I/O)
     * **ZOMBIE** (Finished execution)
```C
int getNumProc(void)
{
  int active = 0;

  acquire(&ptable.lock);

  struct proc *process;

  for (process = ptable.proc; process < &ptable.proc[NPROC]; process++)
  {
    if (process->state != UNUSED)
    {
      active++;
    }
  }

  release(&ptable.lock);
  return active;
}
```
2) ### getMaxPid function
* A system call that returns the maximum **PID** amongst all the PIDs of the currently active processes in the system.
```C
int getMaxPid(void)
{
  int max_active = -1;

  acquire(&ptable.lock);

  struct proc *process;

  for (process = ptable.proc; process < &ptable.proc[NPROC]; process++)
  {
    if (process->state != UNUSED)
    {
      if (max_active < process->pid)
      {
        max_active = process->pid;
      }
    }
  }

  release(&ptable.lock);
  return max_active;
}
```
3) ### getProcInfo function
* A system call that returns 0 and assigns the **processInfo structure** accordingly on finding an entry about a process, else returns -1.
* Below is the definition of **structure processInfo**:
```C
struct processInfo
{
    int ppid;
    int psize;
    int numberContextSwitches;
};
```
* Include **numberContextSwitches** field in **struct proc**:
```C
int numberContextSwitches;   // Number of Context Switches
```
* Below is the definition of the system call
```C
int getProcInfo(int pid, struct processInfo * procInfo)
{
  struct proc *p;
  int idx = 0;
  acquire(&ptable.lock);
  for (p = ptable.proc; p < &ptable.proc[NPROC]; p++)
  {
    if (p->pid == pid)
    {
      procInfo->numberContextSwitches = p->numberContextSwitches;
      procInfo->ppid = p->parent->pid;
      procInfo->psize = p->sz;
      release(&ptable.lock);
      return 0;
    }
    idx++;
  }
  release(&ptable.lock);

  return -1;
}
```
4) ### Burst Time
* Include **burst_time** field in **struct proc**:
```C
int burst_time;              // Burst Time of Process
```
   * **set_burst_time** function call
   ```C
   int set_burst_time(int n)
   {
     struct proc *cur_proc = myproc();
     cur_proc->burst_time = n;
     return 0;
   }
   ```
   * **get_burst_time** function call
   ```C
   int get_burst_time(void)
   {
     struct proc *cur_proc = myproc();
     return cur_proc->burst_time;
   }
   ```
5) ### Finishing up
* To add all the above system calls, add them appropropriately in :
   * defs.h
   * syscall.h
   * syscall.c
   * sysproc.c
   * user.h
   * usys.S
* To test them, I made the following files and added them appropriately in Makefile :
   * test_getNumProc.c
   * test_getMaxPid.c
   * test_getProcInfo.c
   * test_set_burst_time.c
   * test_get_burst_time.c
##  :brain: Scheduling
* Xv6 uses **Unweighted Round Robin** as the default Scheduler.
* A process **yields** if it has executed for a specific period of time and switches to a the **scheduler**.
* Forces the process to give up CPU on one clock tick.
```C
// Round Robin Qauntum
if(myproc() && myproc()->state == RUNNING &&
  tf->trapno == T_IRQ0+IRQ_TIMER)
 yield();
```
### test_sched.c
To test the scheduler, I have created a **test_sched.c** file and included it in Makefile. In it, we simulate
a list of processes with different burst time values, assigned from a list of 15 values. We created 10 children processes, half of them were given a computationally intensive task (**CPU BOUND**) and other half were put to repeatedly put to sleep (**I/O BOUND**).
```C
#include "types.h"
#include "stat.h"
#include "user.h"

int main()
{
    int rand_val[15] = {30, 20, 10, 40, 70, 11, 35, 39, 60, 61, 73, 77, 41, 15, 25};
    int burst_val[10];
    int x = getpid() % 15;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        burst_val[i] = rand_val[x];
        x = (x + 1) % 15;
    }
    printf(1, "PID\t Process type\t     Burst Time\tContext Switches\n");
    printf(1, "---\t ------------\t     ----- ----\t------- --------\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        int pid = fork();
        if (pid == 0)
        {
            set_burst_time(burst_val[i]);
            if (i % 2 == 0)
            {
                double temp = 0;
                for (int j = 0; j < 500000 * burst_val[i]; j++)
                {
                    temp += 1.12 * 2.71;
                }
                int computed_val = ((int)temp) % 9000 + 1000;
                printf(1, "%d\t CPU Bound(%d) \t", getpid(), computed_val);
            }
            else
            {
                for (int j = 0; j < 10 * burst_val[i]; j++)
                {
                    sleep(1);
                }
                printf(1, "%d\t IO Bound    \t\t", getpid());
            }

            struct processInfo *procinfo = (struct processInfo *)malloc(sizeof(struct processInfo));
            getProcInfo(getpid(), procinfo);
            printf(1, " %d \t  %d\n", get_burst_time(), procinfo->numberContextSwitches);
            exit();
        }
    }

    while (wait() != -1)
        ;

    exit();
}
```

##  :chart_with_upwards_trend: Shortest Job First Scheduling
* In this type of scheduling, we must we need to select the task with the shortest burst time and execute it first.
* To implement this, we must first disable the timer interrupt, which causes the kernel to preempt the process after a fixed period of time.
* Comment the following in **trap.c**
```C
// Round Robin Qauntum
// if(myproc() && myproc()->state == RUNNING &&
//    tf->trapno == T_IRQ0+IRQ_TIMER)
//   yield();
```
### void scheduler()
```C
void scheduler(void)
{
  struct proc *p;
  struct cpu *c = mycpu();
  c->proc = 0;

  for (;;)
  {
    sti();
    acquire(&ptable.lock);
    struct proc *sjf = 0;
    for (p = ptable.proc; p < &ptable.proc[NPROC]; p++)
    {
      if (p->state != RUNNABLE)
        continue;
      if (sjf == 0)
      {
        sjf = p;
      }
      else if (sjf->burst_time > p->burst_time)
      {
        sjf = p;
      }
    }
    p = sjf;
    if (p != 0)
    {
      c->proc = p;
      switchuvm(p);
      p->state = RUNNING;
      p->numberContextSwitches++;
      swtch(&(c->scheduler), p->context);
      switchkvm();
      c->proc = 0;
    }
    release(&ptable.lock);
  }
}
```
* We iterate through the process table every time and select the job with the shortest burst time.
*  **switchuvm(p)** basically switches the hardware page table to that of the new process.
*  We set the state of the process to **RUNNING** and context switch from scheduler thread to process.
*  Later when the process ends/ preempted by kernel, we context switch back to kernel scheduler thread by **switchkvm()**.
### Results.
* Testing on **test_sched.c**. <br>

![Alt text](pic_22.png)

* All CPU bound processes have 1 context switch as scheduling is non preemptive and cpu doesnt switch to another process until execution of current process has been completed.
* Context switches for I/O bound processes are more as they have been put to sleep many times. However their context swicthes amount are still in order of their burst times.
##  :chart_with_upwards_trend: Hybrid Scheduling
* A brief Overview of **Hybrid Scheduling** is given :
     * Create a ready queue RQ where the processes get submitted.
     * Set up the processes in RQ in the increasing order of burst -time of each process.
     * Fix the time slice as execution time of the first process lying in the Ready Queue RQ.
     * DO the ext 2 steps UNTIL ready queue RQ gets vacant.
     * Select the primary process in RQ and allocate CPU to it for unit time quantum.
     * The process in ready queue RQ is to be removed IF running processâ€™ remaining burst time
         becomes zero. ELSE move the method which is executing to the termination of the Ready
         Queue RQ.
* To implement this, I added 2 fields in **struct proc**
```C
int time_quanta;             // Time quanta for Process
int cur_exec_total;          // Total Time for which the process was Running
```
* In **trap.c**, we have a timer interrupt when the the process' execution time is same as their time quanta.
```C
// Hybrid Quantum
if (myproc() && myproc()->state == RUNNING && tf->trapno == T_IRQ0 + IRQ_TIMER)
{
 myproc()->cur_exec_total++;
 if (myproc()->cur_exec_total >= myproc()->time_quanta)
 {
   yield();
 }
}
```
* **void Scheduler()**
```C
//HYBRID
void scheduler(void)
{
  struct cpu *c = mycpu();
  c->proc = 0;

  for (;;)
  {
    sti();
    acquire(&ptable.lock);
    struct proc *Ready_Queue[NPROC];
    for (int i = 0; i < NPROC; i++)
    {
      Ready_Queue[i] = 0;
    }

    int idx = 0;
    struct proc *p;
    for (p = ptable.proc; p < &ptable.proc[NPROC]; p++)
    {
      if (p->state == RUNNABLE)
      {
        Ready_Queue[idx++] = p;
      }
    }
    if (idx != 0)
    {
      struct proc *temp;
      for (int i = 0; i < idx; i++)
      {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < idx; j++)
        {
          if (Ready_Queue[i]->burst_time > Ready_Queue[j]->burst_time)
          {
            temp = Ready_Queue[i];
            Ready_Queue[i] = Ready_Queue[j];
            Ready_Queue[j] = temp;
          }
        }
      }
      int time_quanta = 1;
      for (int i = 0; i < idx; i++)
      {
        if (Ready_Queue[i]->burst_time > 0)
        {
          time_quanta = Ready_Queue[i]->burst_time;
          break;
        }
      }
      for (int i = 0; i < idx; i++)
      {
        p = Ready_Queue[i];
        p->time_quanta=time_quanta;
        if (p->state != RUNNABLE)
        {
          continue;
        }
        c->proc = p;
        switchuvm(p);
        p->state = RUNNING;
        p->numberContextSwitches++;
        swtch(&(c->scheduler), p->context);
        switchkvm();
        c->proc = 0;
      }
    }

    release(&ptable.lock);
  }
}
```
* We first create a queue of active processes in **Ready_Queue**.
```C
 for (p = ptable.proc; p < &ptable.proc[NPROC]; p++)
 {
   if (p->state == RUNNABLE)
   {
     Ready_Queue[idx++] = p;
   }
 }
```
* We then sort the **Ready_Queue** in order of increasing burst times.
```C
struct proc *temp;
for (int i = 0; i < idx; i++)
{
  for (int j = i + 1; j < idx; j++)
  {
    if (Ready_Queue[i]->burst_time > Ready_Queue[j]->burst_time)
    {
      temp = Ready_Queue[i];
      Ready_Queue[i] = Ready_Queue[j];
      Ready_Queue[j] = temp;
    }
  }
}
```
* We set default **time_quanta** for this batch to be 1. We then iterate through the queue and check for the process with least positive burst time and assign it to **time_quanta**.
```C
int time_quanta = 1;
for (int i = 0; i < idx; i++)
{
  if (Ready_Queue[i]->burst_time > 0)
  {
    time_quanta = Ready_Queue[i]->burst_time;
    break;
  }
}
```
* We then traverse through the Ready Queue and run each process for a time quanta.
```C
for (int i = 0; i < idx; i++)
{
  p = Ready_Queue[i];
  p->time_quanta=time_quanta;
  if (p->state != RUNNABLE)
  {
    continue;
  }
  c->proc = p;
  switchuvm(p);
  p->state = RUNNING;
  p->numberContextSwitches++;
  swtch(&(c->scheduler), p->context);
  switchkvm();
  c->proc = 0;
}
```
### Results.
* Testing on **test_sched.c** <br>

![Alt text](pic_23.png)

* Context switches for CPU bound processes are not 1 since they are preempted but are still in order of their burst times.
* Context switches for I/O bound processes are more as they have been put to sleep many times. However their context swicthes amount are still in order of their burst times.
